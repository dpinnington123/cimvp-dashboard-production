# Refactoring Progress Report

## Performance Scores Tab Refactoring

### Completed Tasks

- **Data Processing**:
  - Implemented `categoryScores` using React.useMemo to process content scores data
  - Created strong TypeScript typing with `CategoryData` and `CategoryScores` types
  - Grouped scores by three main categories: "Strategic Alignment", "Execution Effectiveness", and "Format Effectiveness"
  - Calculated average scores for each category by converting individual check scores to percentages and averaging them

- **Layout Restructuring**:
  - Changed the Performance Scores tab from a two-column grid to a three-column layout (one per category)
  - Each column contains a category summary card at the top followed by individual check cards

- **Category Summary Cards**:
  - Created summary cards for each category with:
    - Category title (uppercase)
    - Category description
    - Average score percentage with circular progress indicator
    - Visual progress bar with low/average/high markers
    - Triangular indicator showing the score's position on the progress bar

- **Visual Elements**:
  - Used existing `CircularProgressIndicator` component for score visualization
  - Added a gradient progress bar for score context (red to green)
  - Included a triangular marker to show score position on the progress bar
  - Added labels for Low, Average, and High benchmarks

- **Database Integration**:
  - Created a new `CategoryReviewSummary` type to match the Supabase database structure
  - Implemented `getCategoryReviewSummaries` service function to fetch pre-calculated category scores from Supabase
  - Added `useCategoryReviewSummaries` custom hook using React Query for data fetching
  - Updated the `categoryScores` calculation to prioritize Supabase data when available
  - Added fallback to client-side calculation when Supabase data is unavailable
  - Updated loading and error states to handle the new data fetching

- **Error Handling & Fixes**:
  - Fixed the "NaN%" display issue when category scores are null or undefined
  - Added proper validation for null/undefined/NaN values before displaying or using them in calculations
  - Added conditional rendering for the marker on the progress bar
  - Added feedback for when no checks are available for a category
  - Implemented proper mapping between database category names and display names
  - Added fallback text when descriptions are missing

- **Database Schema**:
  - Updated Supabase type definitions to include the `category_review_summaries` table
  - Created SQL migration script for the `category_review_summaries` table
  - Added sample data and documentation in the migration script
  
### Next Steps

- Verify that the category_review_summaries table is correctly populated with data
- Consider adding tooltips to explain what each category represents
- Add additional filtering or sorting options for scores within each category
- Implement responsive design improvements for smaller screens

### Technical Notes

- The implementation uses existing components where possible (Card, CircularProgressIndicator, ScoreCard)
- The refactoring preserves the existing logic for converting scores from 0-5 scale to percentages
- TypeScript types were added to ensure type safety throughout the codebase
- We prioritize server-side calculated averages from Supabase but maintain client-side calculation as a fallback
- The code now properly handles edge cases like missing data and potential null/NaN values
