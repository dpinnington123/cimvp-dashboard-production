# Marketing Dashboard Codebase Refactoring Progress

This document tracks the progress of the refactoring effort based on the requirements outlined in `Refactoring_Steps.md`.

## Current Status

Started on: July 26, 2024

## Completed Tasks

### CR-01: Remove Duplicate Layout

- Identified and removed two duplicate files:
  - `src/components/views/campaigns/DashboardLayout.tsx` (duplicate layout)
  - `src/components/views/campaigns/Logo.tsx` (unused component)

### CR-02: Remove Unused Campaign Components

- Removed the following unused components:
  - `src/components/views/campaigns/AudienceInsights.tsx`
  - `src/components/views/campaigns/EditableMetricsTable.tsx`
  - `src/components/views/campaigns/MetricsCard.tsx`
  - `src/components/views/campaigns/PerformanceChart.tsx`
  - `src/components/views/campaigns/AnimatedCounter.tsx`
- Removed the import for AudienceInsights from CampaignPerformancePage.tsx 

### CR-04: Remove Unused CSS

- Removed `src/App.css` as it was a default Vite CSS file not used anywhere

### CR-03: Remove Unused Demo Data

- Removed `performanceData` section from `src/assets/avatars.ts` as it was tied to the removed components

### RF-01: Improve Type Safety

- Added proper interfaces/types to replace `any` types in `CampaignPerformancePage.tsx`:
  - Created `Campaign` interface for campaign details
  - Created `ContentItem` interface for content items
  - Created `PerformanceStat` interface for performance statistics
  - Created `ScoreRange` interface for score distribution data
  - Added proper type casting for demo data to ensure type safety

### RF-02: Replace Dummy Data Placeholders

- Refactored components to prepare them for real data fetching:
  - `src/components/views/strategy/ChannelPerformanceChart.tsx`
  - `src/components/views/campaigns/GeoChart.tsx`
  - `src/components/views/campaigns/MultiChannelChart.tsx`
  - `src/components/views/campaigns/CampaignTable.tsx`
- Added proper interfaces, props, loading states, and error handling
- Components now accept real data via props while still using dummy data as fallback

### RF-03: Ensure Consistent Error Handling

- Added consistent error handling to all refactored components
- Each component now displays appropriate loading and error states

### RF-05: Fix PDF Generation Target

- Updated `PdfReportButton.tsx` to target specific content areas:
  - Added `targetElementId` prop to specify which element to capture
  - Implemented fallback logic if target element is not found
  - Component now properly supports generating PDFs of specific content areas

### RF-04: Use Constants for Magic Values

- Utilized type definitions to document magic values
- Made score thresholds more explicit in various components

## Next Steps

- Consider implementing actual data fetching functionality for the prepared components
- Conduct testing to ensure all components function properly with their new interfaces
- Consider additional refactoring for code quality improvements (QL-01, QL-02, QL-03)

## Blockers

None currently.
