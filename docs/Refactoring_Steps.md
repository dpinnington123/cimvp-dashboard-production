Refactoring Plan for StrategicDashboardPage.tsx
Clear Existing Content: Remove the current content within the main div of the StrategicDashboardPage component, including the dummy data, existing charts (AudiencePieChart, ChannelPerformanceChart), and cards (Audience Demographics, Channel Performance). We will rebuild the structure based on the image.
Import New Components: Add import statements for the necessary components from @/components/views/strategic-dashboard/ and potentially @/components/common/ or @/components/ui/. Based on the image and file names, we will likely need:
OverallEffectivenessScore
MetricsCard (or similar for the three KPI cards)
A component for the "Content ROI" card (might need creation or use a generic Card).
ContentPerformanceByCountry
BrandContentEffectiveness (likely for the bar chart by brand)
ContentTypeComparison
BehavioralFunnel
PerformanceChart (likely for the line chart over time)
A component for "Channel Effectiveness" (might be CampaignTable or need a new one).
AudienceInsights (likely for the audience engagement section).
Supporting UI components (Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent, Table, etc.) as needed.
Structure Layout: Implement a grid or flexbox layout to arrange the components according to the image. It appears to be roughly:
Row 1: Overall Effectiveness Score
Row 2: Three KPI Cards (MetricsCard?) + Content ROI Card
Row 3: Country Performance Table + Brand Effectiveness Bar Chart
Row 4: Content Type Table + Behavioral Funnel
Row 5: Performance Over Time Line Chart
Row 6: Channel Effectiveness Table + Audience Engagement Bar Chart
Integrate Components: Place the imported components into the new layout structure. Pass necessary props (titles, data - likely dummy data initially matching the image structure).
Use OverallEffectivenessScore for the top score.
Use MetricsCard (or similar) three times for Strategic Alignment, Customer Alignment, and Content Effectiveness.
Create a simple Card for Content ROI.
Use ContentPerformanceByCountry for the country table.
Use BrandContentEffectiveness for the brand bar chart.
Use ContentTypeComparison for the content type table.
Use BehavioralFunnel for the funnel chart.
Use PerformanceChart for the time-series line chart.
Use a Table component (potentially reusing parts of the old implementation or a new dedicated component if available like CampaignTable) for Channel Effectiveness.
Use AudienceInsights for the audience engagement section.
Add Dummy Data: Where components require data, add dummy data structures within the StrategicDashboardPage component that mirror the information shown in the image. This will allow the components to render correctly for review.
Refine Styling: Adjust spacing, padding, and potentially add custom CSS classes if needed to closely match the visual appearance in the image. Use Tailwind CSS utilities primarily.
Review and Iterate: Check the rendered page against the image, ensuring components are correctly placed and display the intended information. Refine the implementation as needed.
