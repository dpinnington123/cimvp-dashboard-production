# Feature Implementation Progress

## Content Reports Page Enhancement

### Completed Tasks

1. **DetailItem Component Creation** - Created a reusable `DetailItem` component for displaying metadata fields with consistent styling.
   - Location: `src/components/views/content-reports/DetailItem.tsx`
   - Purpose: Provides a standardized way to display each piece of metadata with a label and an icon.
   - Features: Displays 'N/A' for null/undefined/empty values, supports custom styling via className.

2. **ContentReportsPage Updates** - Enhanced the Content Details tab to display comprehensive metadata.
   - Added required icon imports from `lucide-react`
   - Implemented a formatDate helper function for consistent date formatting
   - Updated the page header to dynamically display the content's name
   - Replaced the placeholder content in the "Content Details" tab with a dynamic grid of DetailItem components
   - Organized metadata in a visually appealing 3-column grid layout

### Improvements Made

1. **Content Objectives Display** - Added a dedicated section for content objectives with proper styling and fallback text.
2. **Metadata Presentation** - Implemented a consistent, icon-based presentation for all content metadata fields.
3. **Date Formatting** - Enhanced date presentation with a standardized format (e.g., "Jan 1, 2024").
4. **Dynamic Content Title** - Updated the page header to display the actual content name.
5. **Field Coverage** - Added display for all relevant content fields:
   - Format and Type
   - Audience and Status
   - Campaign and Agency information
   - Strategy and Funnel alignment
   - Created, Updated, and Expiry dates

### Next Steps

1. Verify that all database fields are being properly fetched by the `useContentDetail` hook.
2. Test the implementation with various content items to ensure all fields display correctly.
3. Consider adding additional metadata fields if more content information becomes available in the database.
4. Get user feedback on the new layout and make adjustments as needed.

### Technical Notes

- The implementation relies on the `contentDetails` object provided by the `useContentDetail` hook.
- Field names in the DetailItem components must match the database column names from the `content` table.
- All date fields are formatted using the same helper function for consistency.
- The UI is responsive, adjusting from 1 to 3 columns based on screen size.
